# Proposal

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

> **Our role:** Data scientist consultancy firm
> **Target audience:** UBER/Ride Share Platforms
> Ride-sharing operates on thin margins, so inefficiencies quickly reduce profitability and trust. In 2024, only 65.96% of bookings in the dataset provided to us by UBER were completed, while roughly 25% were cancelled. Each cancellation represents lost revenue, lower driver utilization, and potential dissatisfaction. Performance likely varies by vehicle type, payment method, time period, and service conditions, making it difficult to pinpoint root causes.
To address this, our team proposes an interactive dashboard that will analyze 2024 performance. It will track key metrics such as total bookings, revenue, completion and cancellation rates, ratings, and ride volume over time, and will allow end users (UBER) to filter by date and vehicle type to compare categories and identify trends. This tool will help managers detect inefficiencies, reduce cancellations, and optimize fleet allocation and pricing strategies.
> As a consultancy our goal is to suppor UBER’s regional operations and performance teams. We believe our dashboard will help UBER improve ride efficiency, reduce cancellations, and maximize revenue while maintaining high customer satisfaction across vehicle categories.

## Section 2: Description of the Data

> Our data originates from an Uber Ride Analytics Dataset from 2024 that was found on Kaggle, the dataset contains 148,770 ride bookings across the full year and 21 operational variables. Each row represents a single booking, covering ride characteristics, financial outcomes, cancellations, and customer satisfaction via ratings.
> Moreover, the dataset includes date, time, booking status, and vehicle type, enabling analysis of ride volume trends and category performance. Financial fields such as booking value and payment method allow revenue calculation and channel comparisons. Operational metrics like average driver arrival time (VTAT) and trip duration (CTAT) measure service efficiency.
> Crucially, the data distinguishes between customer- and driver-initiated cancellations with specific reasons, helping explain incomplete rides and driver and customer ratings provide insight into service quality and popularity by vehicle type.
> Using these variables, we will compute key metrics such as total bookings, completion and cancellation rates, revenue, and average ratings, while analyzing trends over time and across vehicle types to support data-driven operational decisions.

## Section 3: Research Questions & Usage Scenarios

- **Persona:** James is a Uber executive and is in charge of Uber business overall strategic planning. He is non-technical, but seeks a dashboard that clearly outlines KPIs related to revenue, trend over time, and bottlenecks, so that he can make business executive decision accordingly based on the data.
- **Usage Scenario:** Recently, the Uber executive thinks they need more transparency in understanding the cost-effectiveness of each vehicle type over time and how to better increase the business revenue. Hence, James wanted to know how the number of bookings evolve over time to understand the overall trend and seasonality of the data, to validate if the Uber CEO's concern is truly an issue. Also, James want to evaluate the effectiveness of each vehicle type. He wanted to find out how much revenue they are making, the driver rating distribution for each, and how much percentage of customers are canceling their bookings and the top reasons behind these cancellations.

- **User Stories / JTBD**:

1. James wanted to see a chart that depicts rides volume over time by the vehicle type, so that he can better understand the most and least popular vehicle types and the trend and seasonality for each.
2. James wanted to visualize the percentages of the revenue (and the actual number) generated by each vehicle type, and how the breakdown changes over time, so that he can better visualize how the landscape changes.
3. James wanted to visualize how much percentage of cancellations for each vehicle type and top reasons behind them, so that he can better increase the success rate of bookings turning to rides.

## Section 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
We chose the 2nd user stories, and the visualization can be seen [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2026_32_Uber_dashboard/blob/main/notebooks/eda_analysis.ipynb).
The visualization shows that the breakdown of revenue by vehicle type did not change much between January and August. The most changes are just the one percent increase in the "Auto" category, and roughly one percent decrease in both "Go mini" and "Premium Sedan". In both plots, we see "Auto" brought the most revenue, roughly one-fourth of the total amount, and the "Uber XL" brought the least revenue, just round 3% of the total amount. Hence, the Uber executive knows then the supply of "Auto", "Go Mini", and "Go Sedan" are the most crucial as it takes up the most revenue. The Uber executive can also look into why "Uber XL" has not brought a lot of revenue (i.e. if the demands are simply not that much, or that cancellation happens more).
## Section 5: App Sketch & Description
Our proposed Uber 2024 dashboard is designed to provide executives and operations managers with a comprehensive, interactive view of key performance metrics, enabling data-driven decisions to improve efficiency and profitability. At the top of the dashboard, we display summary metrics including total bookings, total revenue, cancelled bookings, and successful bookings by vehicle type, giving users a snapshot of overall performance. These metrics are paired with a dynamic pie chart showing revenue distribution across vehicle types and a time slider, allowing users to focus on specific periods and understand trends over time.

The lower section of the dashboard provides more detailed operational insights. A vehicle type filter enables users to narrow the analysis to specific categories, while visualizations for customer ratings by vehicle type, booking status breakdowns, and ride volume over time provide deeper understanding of service quality, completion rates, and seasonal trends. All components are interactive and linked, so that selecting a vehicle type or adjusting the time range automatically updates the relevant charts and metrics. This design balances high-level overview with granular analysis, helping stakeholders identify inefficiencies, optimize fleet allocation, monitor cancellations, and ultimately maximize revenue while maintaining customer satisfaction. Overall, the dashboard transforms complex ride-level data into actionable insights, supporting both strategic planning and operational decision-making.

There is a visual mockup showing layout and components saved in img/sketch.png directory. The dashboard will be built using Python libraries such as Plotly for interactive visualizations and shiny for the web application framework, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive experience for UBER executives and operations teams.
